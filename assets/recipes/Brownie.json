(Selfishly, we hope that conviction doesn’t hold.) One of the hardest aspects to nail was the chewy-and-fudgy texture, which she eventually achieved by chilling the baked brownies in the fridge for at least an hour. Sprinkle flaky salt on top of the batter prior to baking if you’re a salty dessert person.","alternativeHeadline":"Claire Saffitz named these her “forever” brownies because it took so much work to get them right that she’s vowed to never develop another brownie recipe again.","keywords":["brownie","chocolate","dessert","bake","web"],"thumbnailUrl":"https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/1:1/w_2000,h_2000,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","publisher":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Organization","name":"Epicurious","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.epicurious.com/verso/static/epicurious/assets/logo-seo.efde9fc575f00192ccc378f32f362af39d4e81fe.png","width":"488px","height":"100px"},"url":"https://www.epicurious.com"},"isPartOf":{"@type":"CreativeWork","name":"Epicurious"},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Claire Saffitz","sameAs":"https://www.epicurious.com/contributors/claire-saffitz"}],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":3.75,"ratingCount":15},"description":"Claire Saffitz named these her “forever” brownies because it took so much work to get them right that she’s vowed to never develop another brownie recipe again.","image":["https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/2:1/w_3000,h_1500,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/4:1/w_3000,h_750,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/4:6/w_1331,h_1997,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/5:4/w_2500,h_2000,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/6:4/w_3000,h_2000,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/9:4/w_2996,h_1331,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/16:9/w_2991,h_1682,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/4:3/w_2663,h_1997,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg","https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fca6f8d9014cc9a8df3d074/1:1/w_2000,h_2000,c_limit/Malted_Forever_Brownies_VOG_final.jpg"],"headline":"Malted “Forever” Brownies","name":"Malted “Forever” Brownies","cookTime":"35 minutes","recipeIngredient":["Butter for the pan","¼ cup Dutch process cocoa powder (0.7 oz / 20g)","5 ounces (142g) semisweet chocolate (preferably 64 to 68% cacao), coarsely chopped","6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3 oz / 85g), cut into pieces","¼ cup neutral oil, such as vegetable or grapeseed (2 oz / 56g)","½ cup granulated sugar (3.5 oz / 100g)","½ cup packed dark brown sugar (3.5 oz / 100g)","1 large egg (1.8 oz / 50g)","2 large egg yolks (1.1 oz / 32g)","1½ teaspoons vanilla extract","¾ cup all-purpose flour (3.5 oz / 100g)","2 tablespoons malted milk powder (0.63 oz / 18g) (optional)","1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.11 oz / 3g)","6 ounces (170g) milk chocolate, coarsely chopped (1 cup)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven and prepare the pan: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 350°F.

Warm the mixture gently, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate and butter are melted and the mixture is smooth.
