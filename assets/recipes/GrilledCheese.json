{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","articleBody":"These grilled cheese sandwiches are typically truly grilled, meaning they are thrown on an outdoor grill over open coals, and are usually served as a sort of snack after a big barbecue (known as a braai in South Africa). They’re a perfect midnight snack and the best way to make use of still-hot coals if you get a second wave of hunger after you’ve eaten a meal and the party is still going. The liberal spoonful of Chakalaka (spicy vegetable relish) makes these extra special. If you don’t have a jar of it in your fridge, you can use any type of relish or chutney. Since we don’t want you to have to wait until you have an outdoor grill going just to make these, we simply call for a hot cast-iron pan. The mayonnaise spread on the outside of the sandwiches means every single bit of the bread will get browned and caramelized.","alternativeHeadline":"The liberal spoonful of Chakalaka (spicy vegetable relish) makes this grilled cheese sandwich recipe extra special.","keywords":["lunch","sandwich","cheese","tomato","cabbage","quick & easy","african","south africa","web"],"thumbnailUrl":"https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5fc543b2f76e8fd5a771edbf/1:1/w_2716,h_2716,c_limit/GRILLED_CHEESE_SAND_6X4_VOG_final.jpg","publisher":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Organization","name":"Epicurious","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.epicurious.com/verso/static/epicurious/assets/logo-seo.efde9fc575f00192ccc378f32f362af39d4e81fe.png","width":"488px","height":"100px"},"url":"https://www.epicurious.com"},"isPartOf":{"@type":"CreativeWork","name":"Epicurious"},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Hawa Hassan","sameAs":"https://www.epicurious.com/contributors/hawa-hassan"},{"@type":"Person","name":" Julia Turshen","sameAs":"https://www.epicurious.com/contributors/julia-turshen"}],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":3.8,"ratingCount":5},"description":"The liberal spoonful of Chakalaka (spicy vegetable relish) makes this grilled cheese sandwich recipe extra special.
